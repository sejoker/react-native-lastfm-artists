On cell touch will redirect on artist page using [WebView](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/webview.html#content).

## Setup

Please go through [getting started section](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) on React Native website if you would like to build application on your machine.

## Api token

Last.fm web api free to use but you will need own api token in order to access it. At first it is necessary to [join Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/join) and then [get an API account](http://www.last.fm/api/account/create).
